# Southern-African-Radiocarbon-Database
Data for the Southern African Radiocarbon Database hosted by Oxford Radiocabon Accelerator Unit and integrated with OxCal (https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/sadb/db - OxCal login required). 

See Loftus et al., 2019, An archaeological radiocarbon database for southern Africa. Antiquity. (https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2019.75). 
The database has been updated since publication but the descriptions and conclusions are largely unchanged.

## ABSTRACT: 
The Southern African Radiocarbon Database (SARD) is a new online, open-access database of published radiocarbon dates from southern African archaeological contexts. Compatible with the calibration, Bayesian modelling and mapping functionality of the OxCal software, the SARD will greatly assist in the documentation and analysis of chronological trends across the subcontinent. This article introduces the database and presents two case studies that demonstrate its utility and its integration with OxCal, comparing the temporal distribution of radiocarbon dates in two archaeologically well-investigated regions, and assessing the timing of Middle to Later Stone Age technological developments across the African subcontinent.

**Histogram of all dates in the database through time, showing the increase in dates for the late Holocene.**

The 14C data and references are included as csv files and together in an excel file. The excel file also includes a sheet with non-14C dates (OSL, etc), collected non-systematically.
